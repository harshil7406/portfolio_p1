     <h2>Story of how I began my journey in Computer Engineering</h2>
     <p>From the beginneng i meant to say from school time i was very interested in computer 
         I used to score full almost all the time in my computer subject in school. Then the first language i learned was HTML 
         and slowly i startrd to learn css , I am taking about the time of i think 10th vacation , i don't exactly remenmber when i started it .
         Then I started learning C language with the help of Youtube and spesially with he help of my Kamlesh mama , he encouraged me not to give up fronm getting errers in code
         , I used to take 2 to 3 days sometimes to solve errors and i still remember i used to code on my phone using a C compiler app.
         Then i somehow got a little grip in programming and I started learning other languages and i found that all programming languages almost have the same logic
         but only the thing we call the syntax is different. I remember at the time of doing all this I started gaining interest
        in hacking , i slowly started learning hacking and if you thought I learnet it from YouTube , then you are absolutely right 
        ,I took 1 year approx to do my first trick which was sending unlimited sms to number from unknown sender also known as sms bombing, at that time i was really happy
        and then what from making phishing pages to payloades , I learnt everything and that too for free. then after all that I started my Diploma in Computer Enginnering.
        <br/>    <br/> 
        So, this was my journey from beggining and I also want to tell the readers of my story that there are many platforms like YouTube, Udemy(free courses), Google etc... etc...
        where you canm learn coding and hackingand frontend and dont't know how much more and that too for free. You just want a keen Interest and a Will to start learning.
